# Flowcharts
This is a repository full of flowcharts on how our systems work, to ensure transparency while maintaining security.

## Info
Flowcharts are using the DIA format, as we use the [DIA](http://dia-installer.de) program to create these, aswell as PNG for visibility.
If a flowchart is used, it is to be credited to the RiiConnect24 Flowchart GitHub repository.

## Colour Scheme
Red (#FF0000) usually represents an error.
Green (#00FF00) usually represents the end (or, if not "END", a note).
Blue (#0000FF) usually represents a database action.
